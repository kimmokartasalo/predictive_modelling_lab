This has the purpose that the model fitting converges in a reasonable amount of time to be feasible for this lab. The example is further limited through the computational resources that are provided in Google Colab.

Since the filters that a CNN learns are not rotation-invariant, rotated and mirrored image patches will seem like \"new\" images to the model to a certain extent. Note that rotating images only is appropriate if the images are in fact rotation-invariant. If the rotation of the image matters to the meaning of the image, e.g. when showing a skyline of buildings, it may depend on the specific circumstances whether it is a good idea to rotate them. However, for histopathology images, the rotation at which one examines a glass slide should not matter. Therefore, it is a good idea to use this type of data augmentation here. "

To get a more reliable estimate of the model performance, we will evaluate on 50 batches. Typically, the number of validation steps is chosen to be a lot smaller than the number of training steps to not use too much computation time on validation. "
